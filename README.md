# CarbonVer

Requirement of task : 
Set up your development environment by installing Node.js and NPM.
Install the Celo CLI by running npm install -g @celo/cli.
Initialize a new Celo project by running celo init.
Set up a new Toucan project by following the instructions in the Toucan SDK documentation.
Write the smart contract that queries Toucan's retirement records and verifies whether they meet Climate Neutral's requirements. You can use Solidity to write the smart contract and the Celo SDK to interact with Toucan's smart contracts.
Write a web application that allows users to input their Toucan account address and query their retirement portfolio. You can use React or another front-end framework for this.
Build the web application by running npm run build.
Deploy the smart contract and web application to the Celo testnet by running celo deploy.


Description : 

building a carbon offset verification tool that confirms whether an account's retirement portfolio on Toucan meets Climate Neutral's requirements for emissions compensation. This tool can also be used to query Toucan's retirement records based on a list of accounts, date windows, retirement beneficiary, and a query string or hashtag in the retirement detail.

This project involves querying Toucan's retirement records and verifying whether they meet Climate Neutral's requirements, which can be achieved using Celo's smart contract functionality and Graph Protocol. This tool does not require the creation of a new marketplace or advanced DeFi integration, making it a relatively simple project to complete in a short amount of time.

You can also add some additional features to make your tool stand out, such as a dashboard to visualize the retirement portfolio, an alert system to notify users of any changes to their retirement portfolio, or a feature that allows users to customize which credits are eligible based on issuing standard, methodology, vintage, proportion of portfolio

add these integrations- 
Dashboard: A dashboard to visualize the retirement portfolio can provide users with an easy-to-understand overview of their carbon offsetting efforts. You could include visual representations of the data, such as charts and graphs, to make it more engaging and informative.

Alert system: An alert system that notifies users of any changes to their retirement portfolio can help users stay up-to-date with their carbon offsetting efforts. You could send alerts via email or push notifications, depending on the user's preference.
